### PhD Student Position
A doctoral student research position is available in the lab of Dr. Michael Landis, located on the Danforth Campus in the Department of Biology at Washington University in St. Louis. The Landis Lab studies problems in phylogenomics, biogeography, and trait evolution by designing statistical models, developing inference methods as software, and applying those methods to selected groups throughout the tree of life. Learn more about the Landis Lab here: <https://landislab.github.io>.

The successful candidate will research macroevolutionary questions using quantitative analyses. Several research projects are available in topics including efficient tree estimation using large phylogenomic datasets, divergence time estimation using biogeography and/or fossils, and modeling gene expression evolution. Depending on the specific skills and interests of the selected candidate, the new hire will help tailor the project so it suits their professional and training goals. The researcher will collaborate within projects, write first author papers, mentor undergraduate students, receive room to establish intellectual independence, and train skills as needed.

### Qualifications
Candidates must hold an undegraduate degree in biology, bioinformatics, computer science, statistics, or a related field. Applicants must demonstrate interest in models or methods used in evolutionary biology or ecology. The researcher will develop within the phylogenetics modeling software, RevBayes <https://revbayes.com>, and collaborate with an international team of researchers and developers. Programming experience is desired, with preference for C/C++/Java over Python/R.

### Employment
The position begins in the fall of 2019 with guaranteed funding for five years. It is a full-time position (40 hrs/wk) that pays a competitive salary of $30,500 anually.
