#### Position:
A postdoctoral research position is available in the lab of Dr. Michael Landis, located on the Danforth Campus in the Department of Biology at Washington University in St. Louis. The Landis Lab studies problems in phylogenomics, biogeography, and trait evolution by designing statistical models, developing inference methods as software, and applying those methods to selected groups throughout the tree of life. Learn more about the Landis Lab here: <https://landislab.github.io>.

The successful candidate will research macroevolutionary questions using quantitative analyses. Several research projects are available in topics including efficient tree estimation using large phylogenomic datasets, divergence time estimation using biogeography and/or fossils, and modeling gene expression evolution. Depending on the specific skills and interests of the selected candidate, the new hire will help tailor the project so it suits their professional and training goals. The researcher will help direct projects, write first author papers, mentor graduate students, receive room to establish intellectual independence, and receive skills training as needed.

#### Qualifications:
Candidates must hold a PhD in biology, bioinformatics, computer science, statistics, or a related field. Applicants must have experience developing or applying the models and methods used in phylogenetics or population genetics. The researcher will develop within the phylogenetics modeling software, RevBayes <https://revbayes.com>, and collaborate with an international team of researchers and developers. Programming experience is necessary, with preference for C/C++/Java over Python/R.

#### Employment:
The position begins in the summer of 2019 and lasts for two years with the possibility of extension. It is a full-time position (40 hrs/wk) that pays a competitive salary following the NIH guidelines <https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/salary-cap-stipends>.
