Our group studies the evolution of life: how has life radiated throughout and adapted to an ever-changing world?
We focus our [research](research) towards macroevolutionary questions in phylogenomics, biogeography, trait evolution, and statistical inference.
To this end, we develop probabilistic models of evolution, write open source and community-minded software to analyze those models, and test evolutionary hypotheses by fitting those models to biological and simulated datasets.
