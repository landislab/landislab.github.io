Our group studies the evolution of biodiversity: how has life radiated throughout and adapted to an ever-changing world?
We [research](research) the relationship between evolutionary processes and patterns through [statistical phylogenetics](research#phylogenetic-inference-with-revbayes), with a particular interest in [historical biogeography](research#historical-biogeography), the [evolution of ecological interactions](research#evolution-of-ecological-interactions), and [phenotypic evolution](research#phenotypic-evolution).
To this end, we develop probabilistic models of evolution, write open source and community-minded software to analyze those models, and test evolutionary hypotheses by fitting those models to biological and simulated datasets.

**Interested in joining?**
We're always looking for creative thinkers who study evolution! Please email [Michael](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu) directly to inquire about postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate research opportunities.

*08 Apr 2020*<br>
Michael and collaborators from Yale have a [new paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syaa027/5817834) in Systematic Biology that introduces a phylogenetic method to jointly infer species relationships, divergence times, and ancestral ranges and biomes from extant and fossil taxa, applied to the plant clade, <i>Viburnum</i>.

*19 Mar 2020*<br>
Mariana, Michael, and collaborators from Stockholm University and the Swedish Natural History Museum have published a [new paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syaa019/5810100) in Systematic Biology that introduces a phylogenetic model to estimate how the intimate species interactions co-evolved, with an application to host plant-butterfly co-evolution.

*11 Mar 2020*<br>
With collaborators in Wash U School of Medicine, Michael has a [new paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1931312820300470) published in Cell Host & Microbe, investigating the evolutionary origin of an insertion sequence that is unique to bovids that confers resistances to alphavirus infections, such as Chikungunya.

*20 Dec 2019*<br>
Michael and collaborator Ignacio Quintero (ENS Paris) have a [new paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syz082/5682421) that introduces a new framework for modeling the interdependent evolution of phenotypes and biogeography among co-evolving (e.g. competing) phylogenetic lineages, with an application in Darwin's finches from the Galapagos.

*28 Oct 2019*<br>
Dr. Mariana Braga has joined the lab as a postdoctoral researcher. Dr. Braga recently earned her PhD from Stockholm University, where she studied the co-evolution of plant-insect interactions. Welcome!

*03 Sep 2019*<br>
We are actively recruiting PhD students to join us for Fall 2020! Interested applicants, please contact [michael.landis@wustl.edu](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu) so we can learn more about you and your research interests, and so we can answer any questions you have about applying. Learn more about applications [here](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/prospstudents/PhDAdmissions/Pages/PhDAdmissions.aspx).

*01 Aug 2019*<br>
Just returned from the [Workshop on Molecular Evolution](https://molevol.mbl.edu/index.php/Main_Page) for 2019 at [MBL](http://mbl.edu) in beautiful ctenophorous Woods Hole, MA. Our lecture and lab materials for teaching Bayesian phylogenetics using [RevBayes](http://revbayes.com) are hosted [here](https://revbayes.github.io/workshops/woodshole2019.html) -- resources compiled by [Dr. Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.com)!

*29 Aug 2018*<br>
We are seeking researchers interested in studying evolutionary biology from a quantitative perspective.
New lab members will design statistical models, develop scientific software methods, lead projects, and publish first-author papers.
[Postdoctoral](people/postdoc_position_2019) and [PhD student](people/phd_student_position_2019) positions are to start in Summer/Fall 2019 (some flexibility).
If interested, please email a brief statement of your research interests and a copy of your CV to [michael.landis@wustl.edu](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu).
A broader invitation to apply will be published by December 1, 2018.
