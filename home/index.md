Our group studies the evolution of life: how has life radiated throughout and adapted to an ever-changing world?
We focus our [research](research) towards macroevolutionary questions in phylogenomics, biogeography, trait evolution, and statistical inference.
To this end, we develop probabilistic models of evolution, write open source and community-minded software to analyze those models, and test evolutionary hypotheses by fitting those models to biological and simulated datasets.

**Interested in joining?**
We're always looking for creative thinkers that study models of evolution! Please email [Michael](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu) directly to inquire about postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate research opportunities.

Just returned from the [Workshop on Molecular Evolution](https://molevol.mbl.edu/index.php/Main_Page) for 2019 at [MBL](http://mbl.edu) in beautiful ctenophorous Woods Hole, MA. Our lecture and lab materials for teaching Bayesian phylogenetics using [RevBayes](http://revbayes.com) are hosted [here](https://revbayes.github.io/workshops/woodshole2019.html) -- resources compiled by [Dr. Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.com)!

<!-- *05 Jul 2019*<br>
Michael's presentation on modeling phylogenetic biome shifts was filmed and is hosted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40TwHG3EoTw). Stay tuned for the preprint. -->

*29 Aug 2018*<br>
We are seeking researchers interested in studying evolutionary biology from a quantitative perspective.
New lab members will design statistical models, develop scientific software methods, lead projects, and publish first-author papers.
[Postdoctoral](people/postdoc_position_2019) and [PhD student](people/phd_student_position_2019) positions are to start in Summer/Fall 2019 (some flexibility).
If interested, please email a brief statement of your research interests and a copy of your CV to [michael.landis@wustl.edu](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu).
A broader invitation to apply will be published by December 1, 2018.
