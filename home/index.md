Our group studies the evolution of biodiversity: how has life radiated throughout and adapted to an ever-changing world?
We [research](research) the relationship between evolutionary processes and patterns through [statistical phylogenetics](research#phylogenetic-inference-with-revbayes), with a particular interest in [historical biogeography](research#historical-biogeography), the [evolution of ecological interactions](research#evolution-of-ecological-interactions), and [phenotypic evolution](research#phenotypic-evolution).
To this end, we develop probabilistic models of evolution, write open source and community-minded software to analyze those models, and test evolutionary hypotheses by fitting those models to biological and simulated datasets.

**Interested in joining?**
We're always looking for creative thinkers who study evolution! Please email [Michael](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu) directly to inquire about postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate research opportunities.

# News

*11 Apr 2022*<br> Two cheers for PhD student and lab member, Sarah Swiston, for passing her qualifying exam and for being awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship! 

*25 Mar 2022*<br> New study now published in PNAS, modeling how regional features of geography (e.g. oceans, distances) influence speciation, extinction, and dispersal rates. Read more [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2116948119) and [here](https://source.wustl.edu/2022/03/new-model-predicts-how-geographic-features-influence-evolutionary-outcomes/).

*16 Oct 2021*<br> With the re-opening of the lab this Fall, our group welcomes three new members -- Dr. Fábio Mendes (postdoc), Sarah Swiston (PhD student), and Mihir Shah (undergrad) -- and bids farewell to two others -- Dr. Mariana Braga (postdoc) and Ernie Ramos (undergrad).

*29 Jul 2021*<br> We have a new paper out in Ecology Letters, introducing a new phylogenetic method to reconstruct how ecological networks (e.g. between plant and butterfly species) evolved over deep time scales. Read more [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13842)!

*22 Jun 2021*<br> Our very own Dr. Mariana Braga [won the Publisher's Award](https://twitter.com/landismj/status/1407379978593898503) from Systematic Biology for [her paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/69/6/1149/5810100) entitled "Bayesian inference of ancestral host–parasite interactions under a phylogenetic model of host repertoire evolution". Nicely done, Mariana! 

*27 Apr 2021*<br> We're excited to welcome several new people who recently joined the lab. Dr. Ammon Thompson is a visiting scholar from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency who is working with us to develop phylogenetic methods to predict epidemiological outcomes. We're also fortunate to have two new undergraduate researchers: Ernie Ramos is a math major interested in the relationship between ecology, habitat, and evolution; and Walker Sexton is a biology major interested in evolution, systematics, and paleogenomics.

*06 Jan 2021*<br> We're hiring for a postdoc to study computational phylogenetics and biogeography. Application reviews begin 01 Feb 2021. Apply [here](https://bit.ly/3hJnoiJ)!  

*01 Jan 2021*<br> Our <i>Viburnum</i> work featured on the [cover](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/issue/70/1) of this year's first issue of Systematic Biology! 

*24 Nov 2020*<br> The NSF funded our grant to model how plant lineages radiated throughout the Hawaiian archipelago! Work is in collaboration with Felipe Zapata (UCLA), Nina Ronsted (NTBG Hawaii), Warren Wagner (Smithsonian), Bruce Baldwin (UC Berkeley), and Will Freyman (23andMe).

*27 May 2020*<br>
A second [new paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syaa045) in Systematic Biology by Michael and Yale colleagues was accepted, which introduces an inference framework to model how lineages shift among paleobiomes, also investigating the evolution of <i>Viburnum</i>.

*19 May 2020*<br>
Our group was highlighted by the Society for the Study of Evolution in their monthly New Faculty Profiles. Read the interview [here](http://www.evolutionsociety.org/new-faculty-profiles/new-faculty-profile-michael-landis.html). 

*08 Apr 2020*<br>
Michael and collaborators from Yale have a [new paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syaa027/5817834) in Systematic Biology that introduces a phylogenetic method to jointly infer species relationships, divergence times, and ancestral ranges and biomes from extant and fossil taxa, applied to the plant clade, <i>Viburnum</i>.

*19 Mar 2020*<br>
Mariana, Michael, and collaborators from Stockholm University and the Swedish Natural History Museum have published a [new paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syaa019/5810100) in Systematic Biology that introduces a phylogenetic model to estimate how the intimate species interactions co-evolved, with an application to host plant-butterfly co-evolution.

*11 Mar 2020*<br>
With collaborators in Wash U School of Medicine, Michael has a [new paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1931312820300470) published in Cell Host & Microbe, investigating the evolutionary origin of an insertion sequence that confers resistances to alphavirus infections, such as Chikungunya, found only cows & their close relatives.

*20 Dec 2019*<br>
Michael and collaborator Ignacio Quintero (ENS Paris) have a [new paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syz082/5682421) that introduces a new framework for modeling the interdependent evolution of phenotypes and biogeography among co-evolving (e.g. competing) phylogenetic lineages, with an application in Darwin's finches from the Galapagos.

*28 Oct 2019*<br>
Dr. Mariana Braga has joined the lab as a postdoctoral researcher. Dr. Braga recently earned her PhD from Stockholm University, where she studied the co-evolution of plant-insect interactions. Welcome!

*03 Sep 2019*<br>
We are actively recruiting PhD students to join us for Fall 2020! Interested applicants, please contact [michael.landis@wustl.edu](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu) so we can learn more about you and your research interests, and so we can answer any questions you have about applying. Learn more about applications [here](http://dbbs.wustl.edu/prospstudents/PhDAdmissions/Pages/PhDAdmissions.aspx).

*01 Aug 2019*<br>
Just returned from the [Workshop on Molecular Evolution](https://molevol.mbl.edu/index.php/Main_Page) for 2019 at [MBL](http://mbl.edu) in beautiful ctenophorous Woods Hole, MA. Our lecture and lab materials for teaching Bayesian phylogenetics using [RevBayes](http://revbayes.com) are hosted [here](https://revbayes.github.io/workshops/woodshole2019.html) -- resources compiled by [Dr. Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.com)!

*29 Aug 2018*<br>
We are seeking researchers interested in studying evolutionary biology from a quantitative perspective.
New lab members will design statistical models, develop scientific software methods, lead projects, and publish first-author papers.
[Postdoctoral](people/postdoc_position_2019) and [PhD student](people/phd_student_position_2019) positions are to start in Summer/Fall 2019 (some flexibility).
If interested, please email a brief statement of your research interests and a copy of your CV to [michael.landis@wustl.edu](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu).
A broader invitation to apply will be published by December 1, 2018.
