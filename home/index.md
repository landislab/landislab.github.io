Our group studies the evolution of biodiversity: how has life radiated throughout and adapted to an ever-changing world?
We [research](research) the relationship between evolutionary processes and patterns through [statistical phylogenetics](research#phylogenetic-inference-with-revbayes), with a particular interest in [historical biogeography](research#historical-biogeography), the [evolution of ecological interactions](research#evolution-of-ecological-interactions), and [phenotypic evolution](research#phenotypic-evolution).
To this end, we develop probabilistic models of evolution, write open source and community-minded software to analyze those models, and test evolutionary hypotheses by fitting those models to biological and simulated datasets.

**Interested in joining?**
We're always looking for creative thinkers who study evolution! Please email [Michael](mailto:michael.landis@wustl.edu) directly to inquire about postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate research opportunities.

# News

*Nov 2022*<br> Thanks to the Incubator for Transdiscplinary Futures for funding a [new project](https://transdisciplinaryfutures.wustl.edu/human-wildlife) to study viral transmission within and between Ugandan primate populations in collaboration with Krista Milich (WUSTL Anthropology) and Dave Wang (WUSTL Pathology & Immunology).

*Oct 2022*<br> New review out on modeling the evolution of intimate ecological interactions among species using cophylogenetic methods. Read more [here](http://www.annualreviews.org/eprint/X7RXSJIBD5WENU8J45HA/full/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-102320-112823).

*May 2022*<br>I wrote a short [article](https://www.anoleannals.org/2022/04/29/inferring-where-anole-ranges-tend-to-spread-or-split/) on inferring where anole ranges tend to split for [Anole Annals](https://anoleannals.org), based on our recent [paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2116948119) on modeling historical bigoeography.

*Mar 2022*<br> New study now published in PNAS, modeling how regional features of geography (e.g. oceans, distances) influence speciation, extinction, and dispersal rates. Read more [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2116948119) and [here](https://source.wustl.edu/2022/03/new-model-predicts-how-geographic-features-influence-evolutionary-outcomes/).

*Oct 2021*<br> With the re-opening of the lab this Fall, our group welcomes three new members -- Dr. FÃ¡bio Mendes (postdoc), Sarah Swiston (PhD student), and Mihir Shah (undergrad) -- and bids farewell to two others -- Dr. Mariana Braga (postdoc) and Ernie Ramos (undergrad).

*Jul 2021*<br> We have a new paper out in Ecology Letters, introducing a new phylogenetic method to reconstruct how ecological networks (e.g. between plant and butterfly species) evolved over deep time scales. Read more [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13842)!

*Jun 2021*<br> Our very own Dr. Mariana Braga [won the Publisher's Award](https://twitter.com/landismj/status/1407379978593898503) from Systematic Biology for [her paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/69/6/1149/5810100) entitled "Bayesian inference of ancestral hostâ€“parasite interactions under a phylogenetic model of host repertoire evolution". Nicely done, Mariana! 

*Apr 2021*<br> We're excited to welcome several new people who recently joined the lab. Dr. Ammon Thompson is a visiting scholar from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency who is working with us to develop phylogenetic methods to predict epidemiological outcomes. We're also fortunate to have two new undergraduate researchers: Ernie Ramos is a math major interested in the relationship between ecology, habitat, and evolution; and Walker Sexton is a biology major interested in evolution, systematics, and paleogenomics.

*Jan 2021*<br> We're hiring for a postdoc to study computational phylogenetics and biogeography. Application reviews begin 01 Feb 2021. Apply [here](https://bit.ly/3hJnoiJ)!  

*Jan 2021*<br> Our <i>Viburnum</i> work featured on the [cover](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/issue/70/1) of this year's first issue of Systematic Biology! 

*Nov 2020*<br> The NSF funded our grant to model how plant lineages radiated throughout the Hawaiian archipelago! Work is in collaboration with Felipe Zapata (UCLA), Nina Ronsted (NTBG Hawaii), Warren Wagner (Smithsonian), Bruce Baldwin (UC Berkeley), and Will Freyman (23andMe).

*May 2020*<br>
A second [new paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syaa045) in Systematic Biology by Michael and Yale colleagues was accepted, which introduces an inference framework to model how lineages shift among paleobiomes, also investigating the evolution of <i>Viburnum</i>.

*May 2020*<br>

Michael and collaborators from Yale have a [new paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syaa027/5817834) in Systematic Biology that introduces a phylogenetic method to jointly infer species relationships, divergence times, and ancestral ranges and biomes from extant and fossil taxa, applied to the plant clade, <i>Viburnum</i>.

*Mar 2020*<br>
Mariana, Michael, and collaborators from Stockholm University and the Swedish Natural History Museum have published a [new paper](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syaa019/5810100) in Systematic Biology that introduces a phylogenetic model to estimate how the intimate species interactions co-evolved, with an application to host plant-butterfly co-evolution.
