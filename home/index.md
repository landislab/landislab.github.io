# Welcome

The **Landis Lab** studies the evolution of biodiversity: how has life radiated throughout and adapted to an ever-changing world?
We study evolution by developing probabilistic models, writing open source and community-minded software, and analysing simulated and empirical data.

Biological research interests for the Landis Lab include **phylogenetic inference**, **divergence time estimation**, **historical biogeography**, the **evolution of ecological interactions**, **phenotypic evolution**, and **pathogen and parasite spread**.

Our methodological interests include **phylogenetic model design**, **stochastic processes**, **Bayesian inference**, **deep learning**, and **probabilistic programming**.
