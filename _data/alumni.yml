  bio: Mariana is now a postdoc at Uppsala Univ. and Univ. of Helsinki with a Swedish International Postdoc Fellowship. 
    #bio: My research studies the evolution of butterfly-host plant interactions and butterfly diversification by combining host use records, phylogenetic information, network theory, and computer simulations. I am currently developing probabilistic models to help us understand the distribution of ecological interactions across space and time.
