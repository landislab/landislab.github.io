  bio: I'm interested in learning how evolutionary processes behave and how Earth's biodiversity has changed over time. My research generally involves designing phylogenetic models of evolution, programming inference methods, and analyzing simulated and biological datasets.

  bio: I wish to learn how biological groups evolve different genotypes and phenotypes while diversifying in time and space. My research brings us closer to this goal by enabling integrative evolutionary inference -- I develop (and use) phylogenetic models that can leverage different types of data across evolutionary timescales. *Starting a new faculty position at LSU in Fall 2024.*

  bio: I am an applied mathematician who is interested in developing models for the evolution of species. In my research, I have developed evolutionary models with process that depends on different factors, such as species age, time, and spatial information. My current research interest lies in developing evolutionary models that consider species interaction with their changing environmental conditions.
